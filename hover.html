            Seven-year-old Monkey D. Luffy befriends the Red Hair Pirates and swears to their captain, Red Haired Shanks, that he will become a great pirate. Ten years later, Luffy sets sail and confronts the brutish female pirate Alvida, where he meets Koby. He then travels to Shells Town, which is ruled over by the tyrannical Marine Captain Morgan. There he meets "Pirate Hunter" Roronoa Zoro, a dangerous criminal whom he wishes to become his first crewmate.</p>

            The Straw Hat Pirates make their way to Reverse Mountain and begin the perilous task of scaling its tricky rapids in order to enter the Grand Line.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">The Jaya Arc is the twelfth story arc of the manga and anime One Piece, and the first story arc of the Sky Island Saga.

        <h2 id="chapter4" style="color: fuchsia;">Long Ring Long Land Arc</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">In Mock Town, a west coast town in Jaya, Bellamy and Sarquiss are forced to fight each other as they are being controlled by Donquixote Doflamingo using his Devil Fruit powers. He is punishing them for their defeat against the Straw Hat Pirates, thereby disgracing his Jolly Roger and in turn, his name. He tells them that he has no room for small-time hoods like them under his command and dismisses them from his crew. Doflamingo then excitedly declares that the New Age has arrived where only the strong and the real pirates will survive.[1]
        Luffy and his crew arrive at the island of Long Ring Long Land, a bizarre island where everything, including the animals and plants, stretches in either length or height. Despite Nami's warning Chopper, Usopp and Luffy go exploring and find an unoccupied house, a tall horse and two "walking" stalks of bamboo. They break the bamboo and Tonjit plummets down.[2] Tonjit has lived on the bamboo stilts for 10 years. He is delighted that his horse, Shelly, waited for him for so long although his folk are nomads and left the place years ago. He also tells the Straw Hats the geography of Long Ring Long Land, which consist of ten islands that are connected and can be walked between on foot during a big ebb every year. Tonjit's tribe changes the island every three years.</p>

            During their journey through the Florian Triangle, the Straw Hats arrive on a seemingly haunted island called Thriller Bark, where they encounter the Warlord Gecko Moria. Using his Devil Fruit abilities, Moria steals the Straw Hats' shadows. With the help of a mysterious talking skeleton named Brook, the crew must regain their shadows before sunrise in order to survive.</p>
